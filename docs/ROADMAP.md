# Next up
- Bloom Post Processing
- More Tonemappig options
- SSAO Post Processing
- Depth of Field Post Processing

- Make transparent meshes pickable
  - Maybe global "editor_mode" on renderer that toggles some less-efficient behavior
    - All meshes get both transparent and opaque geometry 
    - Picking pass samples both and uses alpha test to discard transparent fragments below threshold
    
- Shadows

- Frustum culling

- Toon shader
    
- More extensions (see below)
    
- Visual bounding box around selected objects
      
- Animation support in sidebar (or get rid of it)


- Get started with light culling pass
  - research best practices
  - should optimize for opaque pass (i.e. only light fragments that made it to the screen?)
  - MAYBE:
    - One draw call
    - Divides the screen into tiles (e.g., 16x16 pixels)
    - For each tile, build a list of lights that affect that region of the screen.
    - Write list of lights to storage buffer, indexed by tile

- make it easier to configure initial sizes for dynamic buffers
  - derive from scanning gltf?

# Multithreading

Dynamic/Uniform storages could be SharedArrayBuffer
Requires more design/thought (don't want to expose raw manipulation)

## Approach

High-level, approach is to keep going through gltf models, one at a time, making them each work starting with minimal and feature-tests.

As more features are added, support is added into the core engine.

## GLTF Support

If it's supported here, corresponding core functionality is also supported
