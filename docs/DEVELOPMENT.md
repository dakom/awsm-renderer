# Development Guide

## Getting Started

It's really as simple as:

```bash
task dev
```

However, that assumes you have all the prerequisites installed and media assets downloaded.

## Media

For the sake of keeping the repo clean, media files are referenced remotely on the release build, and can be downloaded locally to gitignored directories for dev builds.

Currently, these need to be manually cloned/downloaded (not via git submodules):

1. https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets.git
  - cloned into media/glTF-Sample-Assets
2. https://github.com/dakom/awsm-renderer-assets.git
  - assumed to exist in ../awsm-renderer-assets

## Prerequisites 

There are a few prerequisites to set up the development environment.

### Trunk

This is used to build and run the frontend demo. Kinda hard to develop if you can't see the output :)

See https://trunkrs.dev/ for more info 

### Taskfile

Used to simplify common tasks like building and running the demo

### Cmgen

cmgen from filament is used to create environment maps and IBL textures

1. clone https://github.com/google/filament
2. build and install: `./build.sh -i release` (make sure cmake, ninja, xcode, etc. are installed)
3. add path to global path: `export PATH="path/to/filament-repo/out/release/filament/bin:$PATH"`

### KTX tools

Used to re-package into ktx2 containers

Use the releases: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software/releases

## Project layout

* [awsm-renderer](crates/renderer): The renderer in all its glory 
* [awsm-renderer-core](crates/renderer-core): Wraps the WebGPU API with very little opinion, just a nicer Rust API
* [awsm-renderer-editor](crates/editor): Helper crate for transform gizmo, grid, etc. 
* [frontend](crates/frontend): Just for demo and debugging purposes 
* [docs](docs): Documentation
* [media](media): Media assets for the demo scenes
* [licenses](licenses): Any third-party licenses needed for demo purposes


# Create maps

Assuming you have some exr file from a site like PolyHaven

1. Create the raw EXR faces

High-res for skybox
```bash
cmgen -s 2048 -f exr -x skybox myHDR.exr
```

Lower res for specular (roughness-prefiltered faces) IBL
```bash
cmgen -s 512 -f exr --ibl-ld ibl-env myHDR.exr
```

Even lower res for diffuse irradiance faces IBL
```bash
cmgen -s 64 -f exr --ibl-irradiance ibl-irradiance myHDR.exr
```

After all these are done, you probably want to move the created subdirectories into the parent directories

2. Package as KTX2 ([GpuTextureFormat::Rg11b10ufloat](https://docs.rs/web-sys/latest/web_sys/enum.GpuTextureFormat.html#variant.Rg11b10ufloat) in webgpu jargon, B10G11R11_UFLOAT_PACK32 for the tool)

_if your EXRs come in flipped, use --convert-texcoord-origin top-left (rarely needed with cmgen output)_

Skybox

```bash

ktx create \
    --cubemap \
    --format B10G11R11_UFLOAT_PACK32 \
    --assign-tf linear \
    --assign-primaries bt709 \
    --generate-mipmap \
    skybox/px.exr skybox/nx.exr skybox/py.exr skybox/ny.exr skybox/pz.exr skybox/nz.exr \
    skybox.ktx2
```

Specular
```bash
ktx create --cubemap --format B10G11R11_UFLOAT_PACK32 --levels 6 \
  ibl-env/m0_px.exr ibl-env/m0_nx.exr ibl-env/m0_py.exr ibl-env/m0_ny.exr ibl-env/m0_pz.exr ibl-env/m0_nz.exr \
  ibl-env/m1_px.exr ibl-env/m1_nx.exr ibl-env/m1_py.exr ibl-env/m1_ny.exr ibl-env/m1_pz.exr ibl-env/m1_nz.exr \

  ibl-env/m4_px.exr ibl-env/m4_nx.exr ibl-env/m4_py.exr ibl-env/m4_ny.exr ibl-env/m4_pz.exr ibl-env/m4_nz.exr \
  ibl-env/m5_px.exr ibl-env/m5_nx.exr ibl-env/m5_py.exr ibl-env/m5_ny.exr ibl-env/m5_pz.exr ibl-env/m5_nz.exr \
  env.ktx2
```

irradiance

```bash
ktx create \
  --cubemap \
  --format B10G11R11_UFLOAT_PACK32 \
  ibl-irradiance/i_px.exr ibl-irradiance/i_nx.exr \
  ibl-irradiance/i_py.exr ibl-irradiance/i_ny.exr \
  ibl-irradiance/i_pz.exr ibl-irradiance/i_nz.exr \
  irradiance.ktx2
```
