# WHAT IT HOPES TO BE 

A browser-based Rust/WASM/WebGPU renderer, without using a full game engine framework like Bevy or a modular ECS like Shipyard (bring your own game engine!).

This does *not* use wgpu, but rather uses the WebGPU API directly via the `web-sys` bindings. This is a bit of a departure from the Rust ecosystem, but it allows for a more direct mapping to the WebGPU API and potentially better performance, control, and easier debugging.

# STATUS

Nothing much to see here yet, early days, slow-moving hobby and learning in progress :)

See [ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md) for details.

# DEV

* `just frontend-dev`

# CRATES

* [awsm-renderer](crates/renderer): The renderer in all its glory 
* [awsm-renderer-core](crates/renderer-core): Wraps the WebGPU API with very little opinion, just a nicer Rust API
* [frontend](crates/frontend): Just for demo and debugging purposes 

# MEDIA

For the sake of keeping the repo clean, media files are referenced remotely on the release build, and be downloaded locally to gitignored directories for dev builds. 

See [media/README.md](media/README.md) for more details.

# GRAVEYARD

I've taken some stabs at some variation of this sorta thing before. Some projects got further than others:

* [Pure3d (typescript + webgl1)](https://github.com/dakom/pure3d-typescript)
* [Shipyard ECS (webgl2)](https://github.com/dakom/shipyard-webgl-renderer)
* [WebGL1+2 Rust bindings](https://github.com/dakom/awsm-web/tree/master/crate/src/webgl)

# RENDER PIPELINE

This renderer uses a **visibility buffer+ hybrid** approach, enabling efficient shading, transparency, and TAA without the drawbacks of classic deferred or forward+ rendering.

## ðŸŽ¯ Pipeline Overview

### 1. Geometry Pass (Vertex + Fragment)
- Run for each object with opaque material
- Rendering benefits from hardware occlusion culling, objects are drawn front-to-back
- Outputs to multiple render targets (MRTs):
  - `object_id_texture`: Encodes geometry/material reference per pixel
  - `world_normal_texture`: Interpolated world-space normal
  - `screen_pos_texture`: Clip-space/NDC position for TAA (post-skinning/morphs)
  - `motion_vector_texture`: Computed as difference between current and previous `screen_pos_texture`

> This pass is animated/skinned, so all mesh deformations are already applied before output

### 2. Opaque Shading Pass (Compute Shader)
- Single fullscreen compute dispatch
- For each screen pixel:
  - Read object ID
  - Fetch the material data from a single, large storage buffer
  - Sample the `world_normal_texture` and `screen_pos_texture`
  - Calculate world position by multiplying screen_pos and inverse view-projection
  - Calculate lighting as needed (may use Camera world position etc.)
- Output: shaded color to `opaque_color_texture`

### 3. Transparent Shading Pass (Vertex + Fragment)
- Run for each object with transparent material
- Uses Weighted Blended Order-Independent Transparency (OIT)
- Outputs to multiple render targets (MRTs):
  - `oit_rgb_texture`: accumulated weighted sum of colors
  - `oit_alpha_texture`: accumulated weighted product of transparencies

### 4. Composition (Compute Shader)
- Single fullscreen compute dispatch
- Resolve OIT: Read from `oit_rgb_texture` and `oit_alpha_texture` and calculate the final transparent color.
- Composite: Blend the resolved transparent color over the `opaque_color_texture`.
- Apply TAA: Use `motion_vector_texture` to blend the current, composited frame with the previous frame's history buffer.
- Tonemapping, gamma-correction, etc.
- Outputs final resolved frame 

### 5. Final draw
- Blits the output to screen texture view

## ðŸš¦ Render Pass Order

```
1. Geometry Pass         â†’ MRTs (object ID, normals, screen pos, motion vec)
2. Opaque Shading (CS)   â†’ shaded opaque color
3. Transparent Shading   â†’ blended with Weighted Blended OIT
4. Composition (CS)      â†’ final post-processed image
5. Final draw
```

## ðŸ†š Comparison to Deferred Rendering

### Classic Deferred Rendering

Stores full material and geometric data in a G-buffer:

- Albedo, normals, roughness, metalness, emissive, position, etc.
- Lighting applied via fullscreen pixel shader
- Inflexible material model
- Transparency is difficult (deferred blending is hard)

### This Pipeline (Visibility Buffer+)

| Feature              | Deferred Rendering      | Visibility Buffer+        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Shading pass         | Fullscreen pixel shader | Fullscreen compute shader |
| Overdraw for shading | None                    | None                      |
| G-buffer size        | Large (>5 MRTs)         | Medium (4 MRTs)          |
| Material info        | Baked into G-buffer     | Fetched via object ID     |
| Flexibility          | Low                     | High (more dynamic logic) |
| Transparency         | Hard (multiple passes)  | Easy (Weighted OIT pass)  |

> âœ… This approach keeps bandwidth low while still enabling high material complexity and post-processing effects like TAA.

## ðŸ”€ Comparison to Forward+

### Forward+ Rendering

- Uses compute pass to build light clusters or screen-space tiles
- Rasterizes geometry and performs per-fragment lighting using local light lists
- Struggles with overdraw and duplicate lighting cost

### Visibility Buffer+

| Feature                     | Forward+           | Visibility Buffer+           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Light culling               | Clustered per tile | Optional (based on material) |
| Lighting pass               | Per-fragment       | Per-pixel (one-time)         |
| Material evaluation         | During raster      | In compute                   |
| Overdraw impact             | High               | Low                          |
| Transparency                | Native             | Weighted OIT (separate pass) |
| Performance on dense scenes | Degrades           | Stable (no shading overdraw) |

> ðŸš€ Visibility Buffer+ maintains forwardâ€™s material flexibility and transparency support, but eliminates redundant lighting work by separating visibility from shading.

## ðŸ§  Notes

- Compute-based shading benefits from modern GPUs (wave/group operations, coalesced reads)
- Geometry pass performs early-Z and ensures only visible fragments are shaded for opaque objects
- Motion vectors are derived from screen-space movement (ping-ponging previous frame data)
- Transparent objects are shaded in fragment shaders using Weighted Blended OIT to approximate correct order without sorting


# NON-GOALS

### Game world culling

This really depends on the specific needs of a project. Some examples:

* no culling at all (e.g. a fighting game)
* portal-based (e.g. a first-person shooter in an interior) 
* space partitiong (e.g. in an open world game).
* quadtrees (e.g. in top-down view)

However, due to the visibility buffer optimization, the impact of rendering unnecessary geometry does not reach the shading stage.
